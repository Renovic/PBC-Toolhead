### Main features
Com-Optimized: COM is between the the rail carriage and the belts
Rigidty: Heatsink is supported, and toolhead uses few parts
Adxl Probing: Low cost probing solution that does x,y,z homing and bed leveling
Integrated Extruder: Small filament path for better Pressure Advance

### Rough cost breakdown:
- Peopoly Lancer long: $40
- 10t Nema 14 Extruder motor: $15

### Things you need to know
- Print the belt clamps out of a rigid and creep resistant material, preferably better than ABS
- Currently only 6mm belts are supported, reach out if you want 9/10mm belt support
- Adxl probing is very new, so be cautious about testing
- Uses 15mm Cpap tubing
- Only compatible with flipped belts for monolith gantries, not stock vorons
